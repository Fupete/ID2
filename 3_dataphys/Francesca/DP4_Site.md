The installation has a huge scale so it was necessary a wide location. Plus, it has to be located near a wall in order to cover the mechanisms and for safety reasons. Only few places met this condition. The one I've chosen is the wall in front of the main entrance. There, it doesn't alter the fluxes and has the views from man points.
The installation itself measures 360x180 cm and it's made of 648 foam cubes (10x10x10 cm). It is self-standing and has wheels to make the moving easier.

Another part of the installation is outside because there it can be a landmark that empathizes the presence of the UniRSM even for tourists.
