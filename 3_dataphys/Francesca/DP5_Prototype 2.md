The prototype reflects the external part of the installation.
The physical pixel are 9, in a matrix 3x3.
The central one represents Saint Marino, while the external ones are the main geographicla directions: this has made necessary to establish some ranges of coordinates to group them in 9 classes. Each external cube goes 1 mm forward any time it receives a new connection in its range. If the number of connections exceeds the run of the cube, it will be set to go backward till position 0 and then again forward.
The cubes (155x15x15 cm) are made in white poliplat and they are connected to a tail (11x11x20 cm) which incorporates the servo motor and other mechanical components and makes the cube move smoothly.
The wood frame ensure the correct movement of the cubes, so does the counter frame. 
The whole prototype measures 45x45x20 cm.
