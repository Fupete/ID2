IP Monochrome is an interactive piece in which monochrome is seen as a collective and autonomous piece. 

#####How it works
When one connects to Reynald Drouhin's web site, a monochrome is generated, using its IP address. Initially coded in numbers, the IP is transformed in RGB (red-green-blue) values. These values are themselves converted in hexadecimals codes, thus giving a unique individual reference colour to the user. The monochrome is generated immediately on the web site and without visible steps.
Without asking, Reynald Drouhin transforms the user in a creator, in the author of an unknown monochrome, since no one can anticipate the colour that will come out. Depending on the country, the tonality of the monochrome can have similarities, but millions of possibilities exist. The active memory, which comes out of these connections, is participative and evolving.
Clicking on oneâ€™s own monochrome takes you to a griddles mosaic made of multicolour squares. It is a monochrome alignment collection of the previous connection and your own. On the top left corner of your screen, a small sized image your monochrome appears and gives you an access of your monochrome in the context of the network. These colours are fragments representation of all the people who connected before you.
The true digital catalogue of your passing and your own identity on the internet.

It transorms the IP Address into buildings in order to create a virtual city.

Is not recognizable as a visualization, and not readable. In order to appreciate the piece as a visualization, the viewer requires some context, in this case that the piece is in fact a map of every IP address on the World Wide Web, with each pixel representing an IP address, its color based on the address itself. Variations in the complexity of the striation are representative of the numerical distribution of IP addresses, and whether they reflect a high density of web servers, recognizable as smooth color transitions, or not. Jevbratt considers her piece an object for interpretation, because the image is not a realistic representation. 


###2 - What it means

Just like any particles in the ever-growing, immeasurable network, you are identified but not recognized. 
You belong without controlling. Your colour can be desired or not, you can like it or not, it is yours but you do not possess it.
It is enforced on you. Another monochrome stands next to yours, you meet the other monochrome - in its exact psychoanalytic meaning. 
You co-exist, even though you might never be next to each other in real life, say in the underground, or in a common space.


###3 - What it could mean

Brightfull colors are shown, each of these squares are the exadecimal code for an IP address, which identify a specific person. 
All together, these monochromes create a beatiful mosaic but none of them is capable of communicating, not even with the nearest ones, there is no exchange of information.
This might signify that, at the very end, the virtual proximity does not help with the quality of the communication.


###4 - What if

This might be interpreted as public square where usually, in the real life, you are supposed to meet and talk to new people
a possible develop of the project could had been to start a community of users, in order to enhance the interactivity.
