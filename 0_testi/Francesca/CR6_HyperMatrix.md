#####Description by the author
Hyper-Matrix is a kinetic landscape installation created for the Hyundai Motor Group Exhibition Pavilion in Korea, the 2012 Yeosu EXPO site.

The installation consists of a specially made huge steel construction to support thousands of stepper motors that control 320x320mm cubes that project out of the internal facade of the building. The foam cubes are mounted on actuators that move them forward and back by the steppers, creating patterns across the three-sided display. Comprised of what at first appear to be three blank white walls, Hyper-Matrix installation quickly comes to life as thousands of individual cubic units forming a field of pixels begin to move, pulsate, and form dynamic images across the room, creating infinite number of possibilities in the vertical, 180 degree, landscape. In addition, as the boxes are arranged at only 5mm narrow intervals, the wall can also be a 3d screen to project images on it.

#####About the artists
Jonpasang is media artist group based in Seoul. In each projects they are very sensitive in combining kinetic, architecture and light, with high tecnology. 
######Brilliant Cube, 2013

Brilliant Cube is a kinetic 3D matrix, comprised of 576 clear LED poles moving up and down. The dimension is 6M X 6M X 6M. It is located at Gangnam station crossroads, one of the most crowded spots in Seoul being a new landmark of Gangnam.
With the theme of “Live Brilliant” each LED stands for the brilliant moment of our lives, and by the structure this shows the frameworks of our time that implies the social shift of each individual with equal capacity tiered in the same distance and depth.
Brilliant Cube, created by a renowned media artist Jin-Yo Mok, in collaboration with Seoul based media artist group: Jonpasang, is not only a kinetic sculpture, but a medium for various messages.

######Noble Mono - 3 layer LED facade, 2011

Noble Mono, 3-layered LED Net-Matrix, installed on the facade of Shinsegae Main Department Store in Seoul,is a 3-layered media facade artwork composed of more than 10’000 LEDs. It creates elegant luxury impresssion by using refined monotone color differentiating itself from conventional showy building decorations. The images about 3 main themes – 80th Anniversary of Shinsegae, Christmas, New Year’s Day – are rendered in totally unconventional and artistic way and have a firm three dimensional look through making the best use of the 3-layered hardware.

Analog wooden blocks (1.5"x1.5"x3" each) as digital pixels. 64 wood pixels in 8x8 make a form. One pixel might make you bored but it gives you something interesting when pixels make a form together. 



###2 - What it means

This installations explores new possibilities in kinetic facades and projection.


###3 - What it could mean

The actual meaning is to show how good Hyundai is on engineering, a celebration of a forward vision the productor wants to convey. The show was divided in two parts: the first was only with cubes moving to draw shapes, while the second was a projection of a HD sequence. As most of the innovations comes from the military field, this installation is to be developed and declined under other lights. It has the power of a 3d geometric mass moving shifting to a smooth surface to project on. 


###4 - What if

"Thousands of physical pixels in a 180º vertical landscape!" This is the title of one of the review I read and this makes me wonder on how this could represent the final link chain on my work. From the 2d image world to the physical one.
