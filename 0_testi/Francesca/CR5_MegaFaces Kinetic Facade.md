#####Description by the authors
MegaFaces is a cross-platform project that combines digital, sculptural and architectural innovation. It was conceived by London architect Asif Khan and engineered by iart for the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics and Paralympics. The project was commissioned by the Russian telecom operator MegaFon.

#####How it works

######The Façade
The kinetic façade measured 18 x 8 metres and consisted of 11,000 telescopic cylinders, so called actuators. The actuators could be controlled individually and carried at their tips a translucent sphere containing an RGB-LED. Each actuator acted as one pixel within the entire façade and could be extended by up to two metres as part of a three-dimensional shape or change colour as part of an image or video that was simultaneously displayed.

######The Photo Boots
Facial impressions were created once every minute. They were relayed to the kinetic façade from scans made in 3d photo booths that were custom-developed by iart and installed within the building and in public locations across Russia. The photo booths captured five photographs at the same time from slightly different angles, thus making the scanning process simple and instantaneous.
A scaling and positioning algorithm developed by Scott Eaton transformed the faces on-the-fly (the system will take approximately one minute to calculate) considering day lighting, scale, rotation, form and additional colour. The processed facial models were then inserted into a timeline by iart's electronic scheduling system. Finally, the images were converted into control data and sent to the individual actuators. 

######The display
An external system displayed participants' names on screens in front of the pavilion and sent them an SMS informing them of the time their faces would appear.
The resultant portraits appeared on the side of the building, three at a time, at 8 metres tall - a magnification of 3500% - for a period of 20 seconds each.
Users will be informed what time to expect their face on the wall. Each participant will also be emailed a personal 20-second video so they can relive the moment.

As part of Clerkenwell Design Week clutch and tote designer Lulu Guinness created this enormous pin-screen similar to the popular 80s toy. As an interactive art piece participants are invited to step up to the device and press their bodies into it, creating all manner of hilarious, touching, and inevitably obscene body portraits. 

#####About the artists

######Asif Khan
Asif Khan’s London-based practice works across the fields of architecture, industrial and furniture design. It is dedicated to pushing these disciplines in innovative and unexpected directions.
In recognition of his design and delivery of the MegaFaces Pavilion at the Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics, Asif was awarded a Cannes Lions Grand Prix for Innovation, the first time the panel have awarded the prestigious prize to an architecture studio or a Russian project. 
During the London 2012 Olympic Games, Asif was commissioned to design and deliver Coca-Cola’s landmark pavilion in the Olympic Park, following Coca-Cola’s search for the UK’S best young architecture studio.
In 2010 Asif was the first architect to be chosen for the Designers in Residence programme at the Design Museum London and was awarded Designer of the Future in 2011 by Design Miami.

######iart
The group state in his site: _"Good design is primarily a matter of interactivity. In designing media installations, we consider form, content and narrative aspects with the aim to connect people and spaces through interaction. As a result, we create holistic design solutions that inspire the audience."_ Their field of action is multi-disciplinary and multi-mediatic.
They collaborated with Asif Khan in designing the Coca Cola's Pavillion for London Olympics 2012.

######URME surveillance, Leo Selvaggio, 2014

Leo Selvaggio has decided to protect the privacy of the public and fight the constant surveillance system of Chicago. This city has a sophisticated facial-recognition software which can identify suspects captured on video. URME Surveillance consists in two different masks (a 3D-printed resin prosthetic and a paper version) representing Leo’s face and a open-source software that can replace faces in videos. Leo asserts that the masks effectively protect you from being identified by the facial-recognition software. For instance, Facebook, which has one of the most sophisticated facial-recognition software, correctly identifies the mask wearer as Selvaggio.The self-sacrifice Leo Salvaggio is making with this project is quite a beautiful artistic gesture. He will become responsible for all the misdemeanors made by people wearing his mask. The project’s goal is primarily to subvert and confuse an existing system. 


###2 - What it means

Similar to a pin screen, the kinetic facade of the MegaFaces Pavilion was able to transform in three dimensions to recreate human faces. It displayed giant 3d-selfies of visitors to the building and sports fans from all over Russia and thus, gave everyone the opportunity to be the face of the Olympics. True to MegaFon's campaign: 'Create your own Olympic history'.


###3 - What it could mean

“For thousands of years people have used portraiture to record their history on the landscape, buildings and through public art. Selfies, emoticons, Facebook and FaceTime have become universal shorthand for communicating in the digital age. My instinct was to try and harness that immediacy in the form of sculpture, to turn the everyday moment into something epic” says its creator.
The work deals not only with digital, sculptural and architectural innovations, but also with people and  the concept on being on the move, always in change and popularity.


###4 - What if
I think this installation cover all the steps I can imagine: it has an interaction with the user who takes the photo and get involved in it, it makes the user proud to be a part of it giving him a 20 seconds fame, the experience continues after the on site interaction because of the video it sends, it is perfectly engineered, monumental and also the meaning is well thought as it represents the actual society. The only what if that comes to my mind is ...it would had been realized in a smaller scale and with a more poetic meaning? Would it be as spectacular as it is now?
