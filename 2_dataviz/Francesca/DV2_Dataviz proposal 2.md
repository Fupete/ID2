###I'm (not) there
#####by Francesca Guzzini

####Abstact
Being someone has several meanings, identity and place too. 
This project analyse the multiple identities, the physical and virtual structure which supports them and the relationship which occur between what is inside and/or what is outside of a restrict community such as the UniRSM. 
Somehow, members from this community are travelers and exchange information between them and the world outside. This happens both virtually and physically even though Saint Marino is well known for being one of the smallest nation in the world. Even its geographical location, upon the Titano, suggests that spreading to the rest of the world would be difficult. 


####Concept
Each one from the UniRSM community has the potential to spread his identity all over the world and bring there the identity of the community. Have you ever thought about this in this way? 
Everyday we built a path of our travel, phisically and virtually.
The IP address which has given to my personal internet connection every eight hours represent my virtual myself. From the moment I start to navigate, this does not remain only a bunch of bytes in a virtual domain but somehow my virtual identity is transpose to a physical domain, the one of server which host my virtual myself.


####Dataviz
my IP address = my identity = a part of my community
How to represent it?
I think there might be to main ways:

1) Data will remain data 
each IP address can be represented as:
- IPv4 192.168.16.31
- binary 11000110 10101000 00010000 00011111
- Decimal 3232239647
- Hex 0xC0480101F
- IPv6 0:0:0:0:0:0:ffff:C0a8:101f

Keeping in mind the stream I've chosen before in the dataset proposal traslated in a binary communication between my IP, the NAT Ip, and the destination IP would be: 11000110 10101000 00010000 00011111 11000010 10110111 01010101 00010010 00010001 10011010 01000010 10011011

2) data will become graphic representations
each IP can be converted in an [Identicon] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identicon) and [this guy] (http://blog.docuverse.com/ ) talks a lot about them.

each representation should be imagined as in motion and at the end of a chosen time interval information will be shown as a whole in a graphic or physic way.
