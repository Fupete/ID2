1) The firewall automatically uploads the reports in Google Spreadsheets.

2) A "Load Table" tab downloads the data from the csv: 
        - Source Ip address
        - Destination Ip address
        - Elapsed time

3) An "IP locator" tab geolocates the destinations IP address 
        
4) The "Stichies Identicons" tabs will take the string lists from
        - Source Ip address: generates a unique Identicon for each new IP from the list
        
5) A "Moving Identicons" tab will deal with:
        - Destination Ip address geolocated: in a world map will attract to the exact point the correspondent Identicon
        - Elapsed time: sets the time in which the operation above will happen
   From the moment this process will be over, the Identicon will last on the screen an amount of time related to the numbers of new connections.

6) A "Glow position" tab will make an Ip geolocated position glow as the number of connections that reaches the point grows.
